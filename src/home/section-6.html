          In order to cope with the climate transformation, application-oriented
          climate protection competencies are needed in order to be able to
          implement measures quickly, specifically and directly within one's own
          company. As part of the Glacier Climate Academy, we therefore not only
          provide your employees with the necessary awareness, but also enable
          them to implement it immediately in their everyday work. Through
          concrete recommendations for action, good practices as well as
          practical examples from various industries and interactive elements to
          consolidate the newly learned skills.
