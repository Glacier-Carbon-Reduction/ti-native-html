              have launched Glacier. We made climate action our job. And you can
              do the same - together with your company and our help.

              We are an international team of climate enthusiasts, product
              experts, and community builders. But we are also entrepreneurs,
              students, parents, and nature lovers. We are united by the desire
              to leave a livable planet for future generations and to take
              action against the climate crisis. We are convinced that there are
              people in every company with a passion for climate protection who
              can get the ball rolling. We call them Climate Rangers. And when
              many Climate Rangers put their heads together, they achieve great
              things.
